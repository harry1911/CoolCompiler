########## Semantic Analysis ##########

# Check of many kinds ... coolc checks:
1. All identifiers are declared
2. Types
3. Inheritance relationships
4. Classes defined only once
5. Methods in a class defined only once
6. Reserved identified are not misused
And others...

Cool Identidiers bindings are introduced by:
-Class declarations(introduce class names)
    -Cannot be nested
    -Are globally visible throughout the program
    -A class name can be used before it is defined
-Method definitions(introduce method names)
    -A method need not be defined in the class in which it is used, but on some parent class
    -Methods may also be redefined(overridden) 
-Let expressions(introduce object id's)
-Formal parameters(introduce object id's)
-Attribute definitions(introduce object id's)
    -Attribute names are global within the class in which they are defined 
-Case expressions(introduce object id's)

The types in Cool are:
-Class names
-SELF_TYPE

Build-in types:
-Void, Object, Int, Bool, String 

Type checking: is the process of verifying fully typed programs
Type inference: is the process of filling in missing type information
